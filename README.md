## The Visualization

This work is an exploration of the Brush and Zoom Feature using data from students solving math problems. Scroll within in the main graph to zoom in and out. You can keep track of your place within the graph by looking at the reference line below.

## The Data Set
This data set that shows a summary of student behavior during mathematical problem solving within an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). The system records behavior such as time to solve each problem, number of attempts, number of hints shown, and correctness. This data set also has corresponding MCAS scores for each student (MCAS is a state-wide standardized mathematics test for students in Massachusetts).
